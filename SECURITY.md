## üîß Secure Configuration

### Recommended Setup

#### System Hardening
```bash
# Enable audit logging
sudo auditctl -w /usr/bin/wallet-scanner -p x -k wallet_scanner_exec

# Restrict scanner script permissions
chmod 750 ~/.local/share/wallet-gui/scripts/*.sh

# Enable AppArmor/SELinux policies if available
sudo aa-enforce /usr/bin/wallet-scanner  # AppArmor
# OR configure SELinux policies as needed
```
